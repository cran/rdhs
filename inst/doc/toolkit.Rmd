## Overview

The following is no longer needed as the CRAN version of haven is working. This vignette is still here though in case we need a non-CRAN pacakge in the future. 

---

In order to install `rdhs` you will require a working development environment. The following guide details how to do this across different operating systems. Please note this is only temporary while we wait for a development version of haven to make it to CRAN. 
Apologies for the inconvenience

1. **Windows**: Install **[Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)**. For help on how to install **Rtools** please see the following [guide](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/), paying particular attention to the section about adding Rtools to your system `PATH`. 

In order to find out which version of **Rtools** you will need to check which version of R you are running. This can be be found out using the `sessionInfo()` function:

``` r 
sessionInfo()
R version 3.4.4 (2016-06-21)
Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit)
Running under: Windows 7 x64 (build 7601) Service Pack 1
```

2. **Mac**: Install Xcode from the Mac App Store.

3. **Linux**: Install a compiler and various development libraries (details vary across different flavors of Linux).

Once a working development environment is ready then the following should work for you:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("ropensci/rdhs")
# library(rdhs)
```
